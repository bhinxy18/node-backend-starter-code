## WDI Instructor Code Challenge

### GOAL 

> Create a single page application that will utilize an external API to request movie data. The client side application will be served by a back-end which will have the ability to persist data.

#### Back-end - NodeJS/Express

- Debugged and fixed the backend 
- Added hbs as a view engine to display the return output in html format


#### Front-end Implementation

- Used Vanilla Javascript to call via API provided by OMDBapi.

- The landing page has a form where a user can search by movie title

- The user will be redirected to the details page once they click on the movie title

- On the result page and detail page, there is a favorite button where user can click and be redirected to the list of favorites


#### Deployment

- Deployed at [heroku](http://ga-nodejs-app.herokuapp.com/)
